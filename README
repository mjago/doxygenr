Doxygen wrapper to enable Doxygen to be aware of __FILE__, and require minimal setup. 

Important settings such as project_name and project_number are checked for prior to running doxygen.

A fresh temporary doxyfile is created per run of Doxygen. This removes the need for several doxyfiles located 
all over the place, and enables the use of __FILE__ == $0 etc.

Default doxygen settings can be found in doxygen_settings.rb. Any of these settings can be overloaded via ruby.

DoxygenSettings class is inherited by DoxygenR.

Todo:
 Consider making it easier to collate links for search documentation by providing re-running doxygen automatically
 and adjusting relative tag file references.
